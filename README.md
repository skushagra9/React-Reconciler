# I Made My Own React Reconciler

This project demonstrates how I implemented my own reconciler in JavaScript, similar to how React handles state changes and updates the DOM efficiently. The application includes a list of items and a counter that can be dynamically updated, showcasing the custom reconciliation process.

## Features

- Display a list of items.
- Update the list of items based on the new state.
- Increment a counter with each button click.
- Efficient DOM updates using a custom reconciliation process.

### Structure

- index.html
- index.js - contains both of the functions for counter and list updates
- react.jsx - a demo react file , which implements the same logic
